## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following installed:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using CocoaPods:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Open the `ProjectName.xcworkspace` file in Xcode. It's important to open the workspace, not the project file.
2. Select the desired target (e.g., the app or a specific scheme) from the scheme dropdown in the Xcode toolbar.
3. Click the "Run" button (or press `Command` + `R`) to build and run the project on the selected target.

## Installing CocoaPods

If you haven't installed CocoaPods yet, follow these steps:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Install CocoaPods using RubyGems:

   ```bash
   gem install cocoapods
   ```

3. After installation, you can verify it by running:

   ```bash
   pod --version
   ```

## Additional Configuration

- Remember to open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file every time you work on the project, as the workspace includes your project and the installed pods.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, refer to the [CocoaPods Troubleshooting Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html) or feel free to [seek help](#contributing).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. For major changes, please discuss them with the team first to ensure alignment.
